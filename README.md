If you've ever started a simple C# project in Visual Studio, it creates a lot of cruft in your project.

These are a minimal set of files that you can start writing a C# programs.

These files open and build cleanly in:

* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code

Feel free to download these files and do whatever you want.
